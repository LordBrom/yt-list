# yt-list

I didn't want to figure out the, potentially ever changing, interface of YouTube in order to find the videos I knew I wanted to watch. Additionally I didn't like seeing all the "suggested" videos. So, I created a simple page to get the most recent videos of the channels I knew I wanted to watch. It was originally an index.html file with a script.js file, but this is the Vue version that actually allows for managing the channels shown.

This is currently a client side only thing, so your environment vars would potentially be visible. Next step is to add a server side.

A YouTube API key needed in the .env file
