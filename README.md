I didn't want to figure out the, potentially ever changing, interface of YouTube in order to find the videos I knew I wanted to watch. Additionally I didn't like seeing all the "suggested" videos. So, I created a simple page to get the most recent videos of the channels I knew I wanted to watch. It was originally an index.html file with a script.js file, but this is the Vue version that actually allows for managing the channels shown.

A YouTube API key is needed in the .env file

Next step is to include some sort of login.
