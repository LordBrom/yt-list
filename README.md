I didn't want to figure out the, potentially ever changing, interface of YouTube in order to find the videos I knew I wanted to watch. Additionally I didn't like seeing all the "suggested" videos. So, I created a simple page to get the most recent videos of the channels I knew I wanted to watch. This is the Vue version with "on page" modifiable channels.

A YouTube API key needed in the .env file
